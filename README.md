# DirectoryRevisionInfo
This is a C# winform tool I wrote when I need to verify the build versions. 
How it works is you select the directory where you deploy is it is set to show .dll and .js files and will search subdirectories when checked.
it returns a table with filename, path, isreadonly, version, company name, copyright, and size
you can export it to a csv file. 
This is useful when you want to verify the build and that the company name and copyright is set.
Note: this is old code that i have not looked at since it was writted in 2019
